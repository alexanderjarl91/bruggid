# Module 4 - Connecting the world
## Öl, Icelandic beers and breweries

Welcome to our Module 4 group assignment for Webdevelopment at Reykjavík Technical School.

In this project we worked with API's, React, Packages, modules and bundlers, UX and much more.

Our web-application is all about Icelandic beers and breweries. The frontpage renders a map with your location(optional) and it shows you the nearest breweries to you. You can flip and sort through a lists of all beers or breweries. Each brewery has its own information page containing a list with all of their beers. In the beer list you can toggle heart or checkbox for each beer to keep track of what you have loved and what you have tried. 

We hope you like it!
